                    <p>The institute has been initiated to address alcoholism and drug abuse, cutting across all age
                        groups. In the present day era, unemployment and financial constraints are major issues as per
                        United Nations figures with an estimation of 87% of the world population living below the dollar
                        per day. This further demonstrates poverty, hunger, lack of education, maternal mortality and
                        unemployment have a greater significance and impact. </p>
                    <p>While the government has made strides to provide access to education there is a huge gap when it
                        comes to equal access to employment opportunities. Therefore due to high unemployment, many
                        people turn to alcoholism and drug abuse, robbery and gang violence, among others vices. At St
                        Nicholas Rehabilitation Center and Nursing Home, we have recognized the need to help the
                        community counter drug addiction through quality rehabilitation services. The institution will
                        provide other important services such as guidance and counseling, training on employability
                        skills and pitch opportunities within and outside the country.
